You can now change the monitors visibility to public. This will allow you to
share the monitor's metrics _(the overview page)_ with your users. The period is
restricted to **1d** and **7d** for now.

The monitor can be accessed either by the **public URL** or/and by embedding the
monitor within a **status page**.

- Public URL:
  [openstatus.dev/public/monitors/1](https://openstatus.dev/public/monitors/1)
- Status Page URL:
  [status.openstatus.dev/monitors/1](https://status.openstatus.dev/monitors/1)

You can enable public mode from the monitor _Danger_ section setting.
